              <h3>Make the focaccia dough</h3>
              In a medium-sized mixing bowl, or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix together all the dough ingredients until the flour is fully
              absorbed. You don't need to actually knead the dough, though I sometimes knead it a few times in the bowl when mixing by hand to incorporate the
              last of the flour...
